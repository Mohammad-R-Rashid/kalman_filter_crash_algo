# Cursor Rules for hacktx_2025_fluffypandas

## File Creation Restrictions
- DO NOT create any .md files (markdown files) unless explicitly requested by the user
- DO NOT create any summary files or documentation files
- DO NOT create README files unless explicitly requested
- DO NOT create any documentation or explanatory files without explicit user request

## Code Focus
- Focus on implementing functionality and code
- Only create files that are essential for the project to run
- Avoid creating unnecessary documentation or summary files
- When in doubt, ask the user before creating any .md or documentation files

## Project Context
This appears to be a game/simulation project with Python files. Focus on the core functionality rather than documentation.
